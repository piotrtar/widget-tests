# QA Engineer Recruitment test

## Before you start

Test is based on Playwright v1.22.2. You can find the full playwright documentation [here](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro). To build the project you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).
In the file `widget.test.ts` are initial steps of the test.

### Commands

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn`

Installs a package and any packages that it depends on.

#### `yarn run test`

Launches test headless.

#### `yarn run dev`

Launches test non-headless with playwright inspector.

## Rules

- Please do not fork the repo, clone it and put it in your own github.
- When possible use selectors which resembles how users interacts with the page.
- If you have any questions or need help please ask us.

## Part 1

Add the two missing steps to the test. In the first step click on the button "Simulate a Conversation" a popup will open with livechat preview. Dismiss the running chatbot, send the message and verify that it reached the user panel. In the second step, send a reply message from the user panel.

## Part 2 (Optional)

Use a docker to containerize project. Use the official Playwright Docker image or build a custom image. Include information how to run test from the docker side in the readme.

## Docker
* Make sure you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
* To run tests in the docker container, make sure docker is up and running and then run the command:

```
docker compose up
```
